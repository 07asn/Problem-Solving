# JavaScript Algorithms: Stack, Queue, Recursion, Linked List Operations

This repository contains JavaScript implementations of various algorithms and data structure manipulations, including Stack, Queue, Recursion, and Linked List operations. Each algorithm is implemented in separate JavaScript files, which you can run by opening the browser console.

## Algorithms Covered:

1. **Q1: Reverse an Array Using Stack**
   - This script demonstrates how to reverse an array using a stack data structure.
   - The original array is pushed into a stack, and the elements are popped out to form a reversed array.

2. **Q2: Implement Queue Using Two Stacks**
   - This script implements a queue data structure using two stacks.
   - The `enqueue` operation adds elements to one stack, and the `dequeue` operation transfers elements to another stack to mimic the queue behavior.

3. **Q3: Sum of Array Using Recursion**
   - This script defines a function that calculates the sum of an array of integers using recursion.
   - The base case stops recursion when the array is empty, and the recursive call adds the current element to the sum of the rest of the array.

4. **Q4: Reverse a Linked List**
   - This script demonstrates how to reverse a linked list.
   - The `reverse` function iterates through the linked list and reverses the direction of the pointers, effectively reversing the list.

5. **Q5: Delete the Middle Node of a Linked List**
   - This script defines a function to delete the middle node of a linked list and returns the deleted node.
   - The middle node is found using the slow and fast pointer technique, and then it is removed.
